            <p>
                Joel learns that Clementine has wiped her memories of him. Devastated, he decides to undergo the same procedure. During the procedure, Joel goes through his memories in inverted order and begins regretting the decision to wipe his memory. He fights back and attempts to prevent Clementine from being wiped, being helped by a memory version of her. In the end, however, it’s pointless. Joel accepts his fate, painfully, and forgets clementine. In the last memory, Clementine says “Meet me in Montauk.” After Joel wakes up, he spontaneously heads to Montauk and meets Clementine again. They fall in love all over again but hear the tapes they made about each other and learn how they despised each other. Despite this, they decide to get together again.

            <p>
                Romance – this movie takes classic romance tropes and utilizes them, usually in a way that makes it hard to know when in time one has happened. The meet cute (with a twist), happy (ish) ending, break up/make up, opposites attract, the classic “introverted boyfriend x maniac pixie dream girl” (re: Popular girl x nerd). It’s a love story, however painful, about two people falling in love, and out of love and ultimately back in love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Science fiction – the “machine”. Not a stereotypical science fiction film, not being set in the future or in space as viewers tend to see “sci-fi” as. However, the premise of science fiction is how certain scientific inventions would change life as we know it. This is shown throughout ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ with the invention of the memory erasing machine (name unknown), and how it ultimately effects not just Joel and Clementine’s life, but also the lives of those who operate it (such as the Dr and Mary).  
            </p>
            <p>
                Drama – this movie presents a real-life situation of characters, showing life as it is. Everyone will experience a nasty breakup at least once in their lifetime, and this movie explores the fallout of this, and the lengths you will go to hold on to those you love – just with a sci-fi twist.

                The Everyman – characterized as “Just an ordinary person”. In Joel’s own words his life just ‘isn’t that interesting’. He just could be anyone, standing at the train station on the way to work or dealing with a breakup.  Joel is the story’s protagonist, and it’s through his point of view that we view the film. Originally filled with a righteous anger, he chooses to erase his memories to get back at Clem for doing the same. However, he quickly realizes that he is still in love with her.  Compared to Clementine’s bright (and loud) personality, Joel seems to be a bland person, often wearing blacks or muted colors.

However, as the film progresses it is revealed that Dr Howard had an affair with Mary (the receptionist) and had her get the procedure so he could keep his “perfect” life. Dr Howard serves as an example of how using the machine means that just because you forget all your problems it won’t solve anything, and they don’t just go away.

The seemingly bright and bubbly receptionist with a hero’s worship for the Dr, despite dating Stan, she seems to think what they are doing is bestowing a blessing on those who get the procedure. She then learns that she and Dr. Howard had an affair, and that she had the procedure done on herself. After learning about what she had forgotten so that Dr. Howard could keep his life together, she becomes vengeful and despises the machine and its ”Powers”. She decides that it is better if the public knew what they chose to lose by sending everyone's files to them, letting them decide if they want to keep forgetting or remember what has been lost.</p>

He steals Joels relationship by asking out Clementine after the memory wipe procedure and using what Joel did with her to win Clementine over, including taking a gift that Joel was going to give her. However, Patrick puts Clementine in discomfort when she wants to go to the Ice but then panics once they get there. Without Patrick talking about Clementine when Joel was under, sparking him to think more deeply about her then Joel probably wouldn’t have begun to fight so hard to get to her.
