                Since beginning this minor and subsequently this assignment, I have gained a deeper understanding of what Transmedia encompasses. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The beginning of this assignment allowed me to put into practice skills I had learnt from my home university, such as analyzing the movie and looking at how certain production aspects were used to leave the viewers with questions. While I didn’t enjoy some of the films that were chosen personally, I am happy to be able to work on ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ as after watching the film, I had a lot of ideas on what could be done for expansion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While I’ve had a bit of practice making media content, going into this I haven’t had a lot of practice designing, so this was a test of skills. Thankfully after we made a style guide the process of making everything a similar style became easier. I was able to use Canva to create the mock-ups as it has an easy to use, interactive user space. I also found the tools session on VR informative, and if we had more time I would have loved to try and incorporate it in our treatment.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel that in creating this experience Geert and I worked very well together and were able to communicate our ideas and visions well. When doing the research, we worked together to come up with ideas and analyze the codes and narratology of the movie. When it came to the practical side, I designed the mock-ups and did the UJO while Geert worked on creating the website that we will submit the treatment on.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am very happy with the finished project that Geert and I have completed and had a lot of fun getting to be creative and put my skills (and new knowledge) to use.

                Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a fantastic movie I discovered because of this assignment. It explores love and memory so honestly and kind of brutally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on this Transmedia treatment, and the minor in general, has been a fantastic learning experience. I've learnt a lot about story telling and myself. I've never seriously analyzed a movie before and that was a great experience, as well as expanding it into our own thing using design experiences I've gained over the past few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I've not yet been able to apply my Game Development knowledge to this project, I am very satisfied with the results non the less. Working on story telling, video editing and multi-media design has been such a fantastic experience so far. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Teamwork too has been a blast. Communication was clear and our views aligned fantastically. While I wish I had the chance to help a bit more with the design of certain aspects of the transmedia experience, I am very satisfied with what I've created, and what we created together.
            </p>
            <p>
                For next time, I would want to create a cohesive storyline much earlier, as that appeared a little late into our project. This caused some personal confusion about story and characters, but in the end we were able to work it out and create an awesome experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, I'm incredibly excited to keep exploring transmedia and especially what it could do for Immersion in game design.
