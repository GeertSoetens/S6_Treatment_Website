            </p>
            <p>
                Our transmedia experience, which is to be released before the 25th anniversary of ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ Is a social media campaign with a live game tie in exploring how memories affect us as people. The campaign will explore a man who committed a murder, and through a scientific experiment at Lacuna to erase those memories but accidentally loses them all. This will lead to him trying to rediscover who he is with help from an anti-mind wipe group. But the question is posed to viewers participating in the campaign and game, is he still a bad person without the memories of the bad he has done?

The exhibition will be about objects of importance to people and their memory, with objects donated with a story from people around the world and some “in character” objects from the movie – like the drawings from Joel’s notebook and Clementine’s potato people.

                Our campaign uses user agency to drive the story forward.  Users will be able to engage and help shape the story by interreacting with the characters online, through social media responses and actions. They will also be able to guide the story through collecting memories for the game, helping to unlock parts of the story depending on which memories have been collected. Users will be able to interact with each other through the app, discussing what they think each memory means and how the overall story is shaping. This allows it to be both interactive story-wise and with other people in the community who are also playing the game.

            <p>
                Jackson Hartman, a man who's lost all his memories, sets on a journey to rediscover himself. Using social media, he reaches out to a public audience for help, who begin to support Jackson in his journey to discover his memories. On the way, users are required to solve small puzzles and discuss obscure memories only to find out that Jackson is a murderer. This will bring users to question if Jackson is still the same person that committed the murder. Throughout this journey, the group REMEMBRANCE attempt to help Jackson rediscover himself and wish to use him to take down Lacuna Inc. the company behind the mind wipe. In the end, Lacuna, Remembrance and Jackson confront each other live, and audience interaction before this point would decide their fate.

            <h2>Style & Feel</h2>
            <p>REMEMBRANCE has been designed with a cold, lonely feel. Using blues and grays to replicate the look and feel of a snow-y day. The experience takes place during winter in New York, a time that is often snowy and cold. This helps emphasize Jacksons' feelings of loneliness and panic while his memories are gone.</p>
            <p>The gold has been taken from the movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", the movie this treatment was designed for.</p>
            <p>Below are the Moodboard & Styleguide respectively.</p>

            <h2>Goal & Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The transmedia campaign "REMEMBRANCE" would lead up to the 25th anniversary re-release of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". The movie tackles similair ideas of memory and who you are because of them. That painful ones can be just as worth it as the good ones. Or that you wouldn't have any good ones, without the painful ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                The treatment also explores the question of who we are. Are we a product of our enviroinment, or are we a product of our memories? If we were to erase all our memories, would we still be the same person? Or would we be a blank slate, ready to be written on again?
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope that, together with the audience or users, Jackson Hartman will find out for himself.
