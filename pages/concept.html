            <p>
                Our transmedia experience, which is to be released before the 25th anniversary of ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ Is a social media campaign with a live game tie in exploring how memories affect us as people. The campaign will explore a man who committed a murder, and through a scientific experiment at Lacuna to erase those memories but accidentally loses them all. This will lead to him trying to rediscover who he is with help from an anti-mind wipe group. But the question is posed to viewers participating in the campaign and game, is he still a bad person without the memories of the bad he has done?

                We propose a collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where a limited time exhibition based around memories will run in Honor of the 25th Anniversary of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The exhibition will be about objects of importance to people and their memory, with objects donated with a story from people around the world and some “in character” objects from the movie – like the drawings from Joel’s notebook and Clementine’s potato people.

                Our campaign uses user agency to drive the story forward.  Users will be able to engage and help shape the story by interreacting with the characters online, through social media responses and actions. They will also be able to guide the story through collecting memories for the game, helping to unlock parts of the story depending on which memories have been collected. Users will be able to interact with each other through the app, discussing what they think each memory means and how the overall story is shaping. This allows it to be both interactive story-wise and with other people in the community who are also playing the game.
